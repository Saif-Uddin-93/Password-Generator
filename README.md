# Console-Finances

## Description

This project was created to practice the practical uses of loops and arrays in JavaScript. In this practice, the scenario given was to output to the console a financial analysis of a dataset to determine the following: 

* Total months, 
* The total net profit/loss, 
* Average change in between months, 
* Greatest increase in profit,
* Greatest loss

These help with identifying key information from the dataset to see if a particular business period was profitable and see if that data correlates with other aspects of business that may explain the profit/loss.

The main things I've learned from this project are:
* How to use string interpolation in JavaScript,
* How to format numbers to region-specific formats which helps with the localisation of applications.

## Installation

For this project, the developer tool I'll be using is VS Code. A lightweight IDE that allows working in JavaScript. It also allows the use of Extensions which can add extra functionality to the tool to help with debugging and making code more readable. The main extension I'll be using is called, Live Server, by Ritwick Dey. The browser that the web page will be used on is Google Chrome and will work on all Chromium-based web browsers.

## Usage
