Password-Generator
Description
This project was created to implement a random password generator in JavaScript. The aims of this are practice my current knowledge in JavaScript and to ensure that the outputted password included:

At least 1 lower-case letter.
At least 1 upper-case letter.
At least 1 numeric character.
At least 1 special character.
The password will need to have between 8 - 128 characters.
The password generator will also need to give the user options to select the length of the password.
This tool allows users to create secure passwords which they can use to meet their organisations password requirements at a click of a button.

The main things I've learned from this project are:

Practive with recursive functions by replacing loops.
How to manipulate the DOM with JavaScript and to create buttons and inputs.
Link to deployed web page.

Installation
For this project, the developer tool I'll be using is VS Code. A lightweight IDE that allows working in JavaScript. It also allows the use of Extensions which can add extra functionality to the tool to help with debugging and making code more readable. The main extension I'll be using is called, Live Server, by Ritwick Dey. The browser that the web page will be used on is Google Chrome and will work on all Chromium-based web browsers.

Usage
Below is a screenshot of the console output of the published webpage:

Below is how the initial prototype looked using prompts to enter user options:

This was changed to using a slider due to getting critique mentioning that it would make the application more user-friendly. The original code for the prototype is still available in the JavaScript file for review but is commented out so not to affect the functionality of the current version.

The formatting for the currency in the console output was inspired by the tutorial on the following blog: https://www.joshmcarthur.com/til/2018/04/11/til-tolocalestring.html
